# Spentris Documentation

This document will contain all the documentation for Spentris. It is intended as a reference while developing.

## About Spentris

Spentris is a game of the Block Stacker genre. It will contain a variety of features primarily directed towards helping players improve their gameplay and learn new strategies.

The code should be relatively modular with lots of documentation. It should be able to be expanded upon without much fuss or issues. There must be a lot of foresight before continual development.

Performance and memory aren't things I am worrying about at the moment, but I may optimize later. Right now, I'm focusing on keeping the code readable.

This document is the centralized documentation of the game. It will contain information about the various object formats, the processes of the game, structures of the files, and other useful information.

Planning will be relegated to other documents that may be created spontaneously and moved to the deprecation list once the creation has been completed. The updated information about the script or part may be added to this document afterwards.

## Documentation Standards

I don't really have any standards at the moment, but I still want some level of consistency within the project. When documenting, follow these general rules:

- Two-space indents
- Use mathematics when necessary
- Use a reasonable amount of headers to make navigation easier
- Reference other relevant parts of the document such as dependencies
- Keep everything up-to-date!

## Object Formats

Default values will automatically be filled in and marked as defaults. Keys may be optional.

### Standard Function Locations
Only used to make defining the functions in `initializationData.functions` easier than creating a bunch of functions. It also has a greater possibility of modularity and exporting because it uses all regular JSON objects. In `engine/util.js`, `function functionLocationAccessor();` could be used to convert `standardFunctionLocations` into a `initializationData.functions` format.

```js
standardFunctionLocations = {
  update: {file: "standardRules.js", name: "update"},
  tick: {file: "standardRules.js", name: "tick"},
  
  // each key will be converted to a function
  
  foo: {
    file: "bar.js", // {string} file to access from
    name: "foo" // {string} function name
  },
  
  // the file to name object is defined in `engine/functionLibrary.js`.
  // the file name is chosen to make it easier to remember, but it's really arbitrary.
}

// how to convert to gameFunctions for use in initializationData.functions
const gameFunctions = functionLocationAccessor(
  standardFunctionLocations, // object of functions
  files // file to object mapping
);
```

### Rotation System Data

```js
rotationSystemData = {
  // contains an array of the piece names
  pieces: [ // {string[]} where each string is a piece name
    "Z", "L", "O", "S", "I", "J", "T" // standard tetromino pieces
  ],
  
  // contains the data for the piece matrices (where the minos are)
  matrices: {
    // {key: matrix[]} where matrix is {(0 or 1)[][]}
    
    Z: [
      // there will only be 4 matrices for the 4 possible rotations
      // the first item is the spawn rotation
      // each successive item is a rotation clockwise 90 degrees
      [
        [0, 0, 0],
        [0, 1, 1],
        [1, 1, 0]
        
        // note how it's flipped across the x-axis
        // lower index is lower on the board
        // it will actually display as:
        
        /*
         * [][]__
         * __[][]
         * ______
         */
        
        // where 1 is represented as [] and 0 as __
      ],
      [ /* ... */ ],
      [ /* ... */ ],
      [ /* ... */ ],
    ],
    L: /* ... */
  },
  
  // contains piece kicks
  kicks: {
    // {key: kicks[][]} where kicks is {kick[]} and kick is {x:..., y:...}
    
    Z: [
      // outer array contains 4 arrays for 4 starting rotations
      // each array contains 4 more arrays for the 4 ending rotations
      // the very inner `kicks` array contains a list of testing kicks
      [
        [{x: 0, y: 0}], // will only try moving to the same position
        [{x: 0, y: 0}, {x: -1, y: 0}, {x: -1, y: 1}, {x: 0, y: -2}, {x: -1, y: -2}],
        [ /* ... */ ],
        [ /* ... */ ],
      ],
      [ /* ... */ ],
      [ /* ... */ ],
      [ /* ... */ ],
    ],
    L: /* ... */
    
    // to access a particular piece's kicks
    // kicks = rotationSystem.kicks[pieceName][startingRotation][endingRotation]
    // kicks[0] is the first position test
    // kicks[1] is the second position test
    // ... etc ...
  },
  
  // contains the spawn positions for each piece
  spawnPositions: {
    // {key: {x:..., y:...}}
    
    Z: {x: 3, y: 20}, // spawn Z piece at (3, 20)
    L: /* ... */
  }
}
```

### Object `Board`


```js
// constructor
// width: board width
// height: board height
board = new Board(width, height);
```

```js
// board object keys
board = {
  width: // {number} width of board
  height: // {number} height of board
  matrix: // {BoardMino[][]} board matrix
}
```

### Object `Puzzle`

```js
puzzle = new Puzzle({
  parameters: // {object} becomes `this.parameters`
  values: // {object} stacker initialization values
  
  winConditions: // {puzzleFunction[]}
  lossConditions: // {puzzleFunction[]}
  // prioritizeWinCondition: true, // {boolean}
  initFunction: // {puzzleFunction}
});
```

```js
puzzle = {
  version: 1, // {number | string} puzzle version
  // not to be confused with parameter versions, those are separate
  
  parameters: {
    // the parameters as specified by *Stacker Parameters*
  },
  
  // if any of the conditions are true the game will end on a win
  winConditions: // {puzzleFunction[]}
  
  // if any of the conditions are false the game will end on a loss
  lossConditions: // {puzzleFunction[]}
  
  // if both end functions activate at the same time
  // will the player win?
  // prioritizeWinCondition: true, // {boolean}
  
  // init function to run before the game starts
  initFunction: // {puzzleFunction}
}
```

```js
puzzleFunction: {
  version: 1, // version of puzzle function
  type: // {string} the type of end condition or function
  parameters: // {object} the data for end condition or function
  func: // {function} function generated or provided
}
```
When the puzzle is saved as a JSON file, the `func` functions cannot be represented. The `type` and `parameters` should hopefully be enough to reconstruct the `func` function.

Both `initFunction` and `(win/loss)Conditions[i]` should use the exact same format, including for the list of valid types. Although it may not make sense, it's all just functions in the end, just ran at different points in time.

`prioritizeWinCondition` is not really possible to enforce, so consider removing its existence from all the comments.

### `clearsFinish` Puzzle Function Format

```js
const puzzleFunction = {
  clears: [
    // clear objects with omitted keys
    // if the keys are omitted, then it can be any value
    
    { // TSD
      lines: 2,
      piece: "T",
      spin: "full"
    },
    
    { // PC with I
      piece: "I",
      perfectClear: true
    }
  ],
  
  type: "all", // {string} how to handle the clears
  
  type: "all", // all clears must be cleared in any order
  type: "sequential", // all clears must be cleared in order
  
  endType: "clearsFinish", // {string} type of end event to emit
}
```

## Future Object Formats

### Puzzle Set

```js
puzzleSet = {
  name: // {string}
  
  // keys will map to puzzles
  // it is not an array because it's easier to organize keys
  puzzles: {
    // {key: Puzzle}
  },
  
  // randomization distribution
  // the key refers to the puzzle and the default weighing is 1
  // change to a higher number for a better chance at being chosen
  distribution: // {key: Number}
}
```

    });
    ```

### Menu

  - *emitted when the menu requests for a game to start*
  - ```js
    this.event.emit("gameStart", {
      time: Date.now(), // {number} the timestamp of occurrence
      mode: // {string} the mode that is being played
      settings: { // {object} the settings for the game
        values: // the main settings
        defaults: // the fallback settings
      },
      initFunction: // {function} the function to run on game start
    });
    ```
- `menuChange`
  - *emitted on every menu change*
  - ```js
    this.event.emit("menuChange", {
      time: Date.now(), // {number} the timestamp of occurrence
      previousMenu: // {string} the previous menu name
      currentMenu: // {string} the current menu name
    }

## Mathematics

### Current Level
The current level, as determined from a function of the number of lines cleared, $l$, is equal to:

$$\left\lfloor 10l \right\rfloor$$

### Drop Speed
The current drop speed in $\text{ms} \times \text{lines}^{-1}$ is equal to:

$$\frac{1000 \text{ms}}{\text{lines}} \times \left(0.8 - 0.7\left(\text{level} - 1\right)\right)^{\text{level}-1}$$

### Lock Delay
The lock delay is a function of the form $\frac{1}{bx + c}$ where it is defined to intersect two points $\alpha$ and $\beta$. In the game, $\alpha$ is chosen to be at $(\text{level}\,20, 500\text{ms})$ and $\beta$ at $(\text{level}\,40, 150\text{ms})$. In terms of $x$, $x_l$ will denote the level and $x_d$ will denote the lock *d*elay.  To solve for $b$ and $c$ in terms of $\alpha$ and $\beta$, just isolate it.

$$
\begin{cases}
  \frac{1}{\alpha_l b + c} = \alpha_d \\
  \frac{1}{\beta_l b + c} = \beta_d \\
\end{cases}
$$

$$
\begin{cases}
  1 = \alpha_d \left(\alpha_l b + c \right) \\
  1 = \beta_d \left(\beta_l b + c \right) \\
\end{cases}
$$

Isolate $b$ from the first equation.

$$
1 = \alpha_d \alpha_l b + \alpha_d c
$$

$$
b = \frac{1 - \alpha_d c}{\alpha_d \alpha_l}
$$

Plug $b$ into the second equation.

$$
1 = \beta_d \left(\beta_l \frac{1 - \alpha_d c}{\alpha_d \alpha_l} + c \right)
$$

Isolate $c$.

$$
\frac{1}{\beta_d} = \beta_l \frac{1 - \alpha_d c}{\alpha_d \alpha_l} + c
$$

$$
\frac{1}{\beta_d} = \frac{\beta_l}{\alpha_d \alpha_l} - \frac{\beta_l \alpha_d c}{\alpha_d \alpha_l} + c
$$

$$
\frac{1}{\beta_d} = \frac{\beta_l}{\alpha_d \alpha_l} + c \left(1 - \frac{\beta_l \alpha_d}{\alpha_d \alpha_l} \right)
$$

$$
\frac{\frac{1}{\beta_d} - \frac{\beta_l}{\alpha_d \alpha_l}}{1 - \frac{\beta_l \alpha_d}{\alpha_d \alpha_l}} = c
$$

Simplify.

$$
c
= \frac{\frac{1}{\beta_d} - \frac{\beta_l}{\alpha_d \alpha_l}}{1 - \frac{\beta_l \alpha_c}{\alpha_d \alpha_l}}
= \frac{\frac{\alpha_d \alpha_l - \beta_l \beta_d}{\alpha_d \alpha_l \beta_d}}{\frac{\alpha_d \alpha_l - \beta_l \alpha_d}{\alpha_d \alpha_l}}
$$

Make it a single fraction.

$$
= \frac{\alpha_d \alpha_l \left(\alpha_d \alpha_l - \beta_l \beta_d \right)}{\alpha_d \alpha_l \beta_d \left(\alpha_d \alpha_l - \beta_l \alpha_d \right)}
= \frac{\alpha_d \alpha_l - \beta_l \beta_d}{\beta_d \left(\alpha_d \alpha_l - \beta_l \alpha_d \right)}
= \frac{\alpha_d \alpha_l - \beta_l \beta_d}{\beta_d \alpha_d \left(\alpha_l - \beta_l \right)}
$$

Answer:

$$
c = \frac{\alpha_d \alpha_l - \beta_l \beta_d}{\beta_d \alpha_d \left(\alpha_l - \beta_l \right)}
$$

$$
b = \frac{1 - \alpha_d c}{\alpha_d \alpha_l}
$$

Plugging the specified values for $\alpha$ and $\beta$ yields these values: $c = - \frac{1}{375}$, $b = \frac{7}{30000}$

### Score

- $1$ point for every line moved down by soft drop
- $2$ points for every line moved down by hard drop

#### Line Clears
- *the number of line clears is equal to $l$*
- *the number of combo is equal to $c$*
- **0** lines cleared
  - $+0 \text{ points}$ for no spin
  - $+100 \text{ points}$ for mini spin
  - $+400 \text{ points}$ for full spin
- **â‰¥1** line cleared
  - *no spin*
    - $
      \begin{cases} 
        100 \text{ points}, & \text{if } l = 1 \\
        300 \text{ points}, & \text{if } l = 2 \\
        500 \text{ points}, & \text{if } l = 3 \\
        800 \text{ points}, & \text{if } l = 4
      \end{cases}
      $ 
  - *mini spin*
    - $+200l \text{ points}$
  - *full spin*
    - $+400(l+1) \text{ points}$
- **afterwards**
  1. multiply number of points gained by $1.5$ if there is b2b
  2. add $50c$ if there is combo
  3. check for perfect clear and add the corresponding score if necessary
  4. multiply number of points (after steps 1-3) by the level count
- **perfect clear**
  - add $
    \begin{cases} 
      800 \text{ points}, & \text{if } l = 1 \\
      1200 \text{ points}, & \text{if } l = 2 \\
      2000 \text{ points}, & \text{if } l = 3 \\
      3200 \text{ points}, & \text{if } l = 4
    \end{cases}
    $
