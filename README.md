# Spentris

Spentris is a game of the Block Stacker genre. It will contain a variety of features ranging from learning material to gameplay. The program is intended for use by beginners to learn new strategies and for professionals to refresh and review their skills. All intended use purposes will be listed below:

-	Puzzles to practice new strategies
-	Lessons to teach new strategies
-	Ability to play generic game modes
-	Multiplayer over WebSocket
  If not, create 1v1 vs bots
-	Separability of UI and Game Engine
  - Allows for separate refactoring
  - More expandability
- As a passive finesse trainer

Of all the features, the most important is to allow for expandability. This will allow for the program to continually be improved without refactoring.
