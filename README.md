# Spentris

This repository houses the *second version* of Spentris. The motivation for creating a brand new version was because of the rashness, hastiness, and spaghettification of the old code. I was unable to continue working on the previous version, so I planned and created a new version over many months. This time, I was attentive to ensure that there was sufficient planning and lookahead involved with the project. Modularity within the project is heavily utilized to make swapping parts easier. Comments must be somewhat frequent but not redundant.

## Documentation

The documentation can be found in `docs.md`.
